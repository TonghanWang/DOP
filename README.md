* Results reported in the paper can be reproduced by setting test_greedy to True, which uses argmax to select actions when testing. We have updated the default settings in our codebase.

<span style="color:red"> *The default hyper-parameter setting was fine tuned with a parallel runner using 4 parallel environments. The latest version of PyMARL uses an episode runner. Current hyper-parameters may be unstable with this runner.* </span>

# DOP: Off-Policy Multi-Agent Decomposed Policy Gradients

## Note
This codebase accompanies paper "**DOP: Off-Policy Multi-Agent Decomposed Policy Gradients**" ([Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12322)) and implements stochastic DOP. The implementation is based on [PyMARL](https://github.com/oxwhirl/pymarl) and [SMAC](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac) codebases which are open-sourced.

The implementation of the following methods can also be found in this codebase, which are finished by the authors of [PyMARL](https://github.com/oxwhirl/pymarl):

- [**QMIX**: QMIX: Monotonic Value Function Factorisation for Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11485)
- [**VDN**: Value-Decomposition Networks For Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05296) 
- [**IQL**: Independent Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08779)

## Installation instructions

Build the Dockerfile using 
```shell
cd docker
bash build.sh
```

Set up StarCraft II and SMAC:
```shell
bash install_sc2.sh
```

This will download SC2 into the 3rdparty folder and copy the maps necessary to run over.

The `requirements.txt` file can be used to install the necessary packages into a virtual environment (not recommended).

## Run an experiment 

```shell
python3 src/main.py --config=offpg_smac --env-config=sc2 with env_args.map_name=10m_vs_11m
```

The config files act as defaults for an algorithm or environment. 

They are all located in `src/config`.
`--config` refers to the config files in `src/config/algs`
`--env-config` refers to the config files in `src/config/envs`

To run experiments using the Docker container:
```shell
bash run.sh $GPU python3 src/main.py -config=offpg_smac --env-config=sc2 with env_args.map_name=10m_vs_11m
```

All results will be stored in the `Results` folder.

## Saving and loading learnt models

### Saving models

You can save the learnt models to disk by setting `save_model = True`, which is set to `False` by default. The frequency of saving models can be adjusted using `save_model_interval` configuration. Models will be saved in the result directory, under the folder called *models*. The directory corresponding each run will contain models saved throughout the experiment, each within a folder corresponding to the number of timesteps passed since starting the learning process.

### Loading models

Learnt models can be loaded using the `checkpoint_path` parameter, after which the learning will proceed from the corresponding timestep. 

## Watching StarCraft II replays

`save_replay` option allows saving replays of models which are loaded using `checkpoint_path`. Once the model is successfully loaded, `test_nepisode` number of episodes are run on the test mode and a .SC2Replay file is saved in the Replay directory of StarCraft II. Please make sure to use the episode runner if you wish to save a replay, i.e., `runner=episode`. The name of the saved replay file starts with the given `env_args.save_replay_prefix` (map_name if empty), followed by the current timestamp. 

The saved replays can be watched by double-clicking on them or using the following command:

```shell
python -m pysc2.bin.play --norender --rgb_minimap_size 0 --replay NAME.SC2Replay
```

**Note:** Replays cannot be watched using the Linux version of StarCraft II. Please use either the Mac or Windows version of the StarCraft II client.
